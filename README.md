# 42 Stepper Motor Mod For Boxturtle
[中文](README_zh.md)


!English is not my native language!

!All English comes from translation software!

This is a mod that uses a 42 step motor and a regular BMG extruder to replace the extruder part of Boxturtle

This mod has not been actually tested

The picture shows a thick 42 stepper motor because I don't have a thin 42 stepper motor on hand. Please use a thin 42 stepper motor for actual installation.
